SiteMapper is a desktop application that can generate a web.sitemap from a static asp.net webform application.

It reads each file and generates appropiate sitemap nodes with the url, the title and description.

it has filters for folders and files (not implemented in the gui yet XD), and outputs to a table as well as a web.sitemap file.
